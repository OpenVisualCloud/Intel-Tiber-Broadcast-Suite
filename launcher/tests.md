Prepare environment for testing the `launcher` project. Refer to the guidelines to set up your environment and run the tests [guidelines](./internal/controller/README.md).


From the root of the `launcher` project go to appropriate directory that contains .*_test.go file and run:
```bash
go test ./... -v
```
This command will execute all the tests in the project and display detailed output for each test case. Make sure you have Go installed and your environment is set up correctly to run Go tests. If you encounter any issues, check your Go installation and ensure that all dependencies are properly configured.
