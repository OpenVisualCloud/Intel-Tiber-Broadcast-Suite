# Contributing to Intel® Tiber™ Broadcast Suite

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD 3-Clause Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Intel-Tiber-Broadcast-Suite/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Intel-Tiber-Broadcast-Suite/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can use an automatic formatter like `prettier`.
* Run linters to check your code.
* Follow the `super-linter` example provided in the README.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its BSD 3-Clause License.
