# Architecture

## 1. Overview
The Intel® Tiber™ Broadcast Suite is a software-based package designed for creation of high-performance and high-quality solutions used in live video production. The video pipelines are built using Intel-optimized version of FFmpeg and combine: media transport protocols (SMPTE ST 2110-compliant), JPEG XS encoding/decoding, GPU media processing and rendering.

## 2. Software Architecture

The Intel® Tiber™ Broadcast Suite uses open-source FFmpeg framework as a baseline, and enhances it with:
- Media Transport Library (MTL) with SMPTE 2110 transport protocols and yuv422p10le and y210le pixel formats.
- Intel® QSV and OneVPL libraries to support hardware-accelerated media processing with Intel Flex GPU cards.
- DPC++ kernels to enable custom effect filters used in video production (not supported in this release).
- OpenGL/Vulkan integration to display rendering effects (not supported in this release).

The software package includes several performance features on top of regular [Intel's Cartwheel FFmpeg](https://github.com/intel/cartwheel-ffmpeg/) upstream patches:
- memory management optimizations for page-aligned surface allocations
- asynchronous execution of video pipeline filters to maximize GPU utilization
- high-throughput GPU-CPU memory data transfers
